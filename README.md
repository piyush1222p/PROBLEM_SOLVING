# PROBLEM_SOLVING
A curated, standards-driven archive of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) solutions across multiple coding platforms.

This repository exists as a professional record of my problem-solving journey. It emphasizes clear approaches, correctness, complexity awareness, and clean code—serving both as a revision resource and a portfolio of my algorithmic thinking.

## Highlights
- Consistent solution structure with approach notes and complexity analysis
- Categorized by platform and topic for fast lookup
- Emphasis on edge cases, alternative approaches, and test coverage (where applicable)
- Continual, incremental improvement of earlier solutions

## Goals
- Track personal progress across platforms in a structured way
- Demonstrate problem-solving rigor for interviews and peer review
- Build a reusable reference for patterns, templates, and common pitfalls

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by platform, then by topic. A typical structure looks like:

```
PROBLEM_SOLVING/
├── LICENSE
├── PlatformName/                  # e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces, GfG, AtCoder, HackerRank
│   ├── Arrays/
│   │   ├── two_sum.ext
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Strings/
│   ├── LinkedList/
│   ├── Trees/
│   ├── Graphs/
│   ├── DP/
│   ├── Greedy/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Notes:
- File names follow the problem name or a concise slug from the platform.
- Each solution file begins with a short metadata header (see below) and includes the approach and complexity.

## Solution Metadata Convention
Each solution should start with a brief metadata block to aid indexing and review:

```
Problem: <Exact problem title>
Platform: <LeetCode | Codeforces | GfG | ...>
Link: <URL to original problem>
Difficulty: <Easy | Medium | Hard>
Topics: <Array, Two Pointers, Hash Map, ...>
Approach: <One-paragraph summary of idea and key insight>
Time Complexity: O(...)
Space Complexity: O(...)
Notes: <Edge cases, alternatives, trade-offs>
```

## Coding Standards
- Clarity before cleverness: prefer readable, maintainable code.
- Always annotate time and space complexity.
- Document non-trivial invariants, proofs of correctness, and corner cases.
- Include minimal test inputs/examples where helpful.
- Keep functions focused; avoid unnecessary globals.
- Prefer deterministic, iterative solutions unless recursion is clearly superior.

## How to Navigate
- By platform: open the folder for the platform you’re interested in.
- By topic: subfolders segment problems into common DSA categories.
- By difficulty: check the metadata header at the top of each solution file.

## How to Run
Since solutions may be in different languages, use the standard toolchain for each:
- C++: g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp && ./a.out
- Python: python file.py or python3 file.py
- Java: javac File.java && java File
- JavaScript/Node: node file.js

When present, per-file comments include any input format expectations or sample runs.

## Progress and Index
I maintain progress by enriching each file’s metadata and keeping a consistent structure. Optionally, an index (table) can be added later to this README or a separate INDEX.md to summarize:
- Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Topic(s) | Link | Solution Path

If you’d like me to auto-generate this index from the repository tree, I can add a small script and GitHub Action.

## Approach Philosophy
- Understand: restate the problem and constraints in my own words.
- Baseline: outline a brute-force solution to anchor correctness.
- Optimize: identify bottlenecks and apply relevant patterns (two pointers, sliding window, greedy, divide-and-conquer, DP, graph algorithms).
- Validate: reason about edge cases and prove or argue correctness.
- Analyze: document time/space complexity and potential trade-offs.

## Contributing
This is primarily a personal archive. However, suggestions and improvements are welcome:
- Open a pull request for clarifications, alternative approaches, or improved explanations.
- Keep the metadata header and coding standards consistent.
- Be respectful and concise in commit messages and PR descriptions.
